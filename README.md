# moneyManager

Goals:
========================
* modelBlender: from a collection of orders and its outcomes produce an strategy that 'minimizes risk'. This, of course involves carefully backtesting each model and the joint model
* dataGathering: get csv files of as many stocks as possible, frequency=1sec
* basicModeling: systematically produce very simple strategies. Example: if value pases some threshold we should buy and keep until something else happens.
